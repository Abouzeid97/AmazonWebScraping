‚ùì Why Selenium?

While BeautifulSoup is a great tool for parsing static HTML, Amazon dynamically loads product data and actively implements bot detection mechanisms that block traditional scrapers. Therefore, this project uses Selenium, which:

Interacts with the website like a real user.

Handles JavaScript-rendered content.

Helps bypass bot protection and load dynamic elements reliably.


This ensures more accurate and consistent scraping results from Amazon.eg.
